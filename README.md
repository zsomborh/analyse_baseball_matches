# analyse_baseball_matches

This Github repository contains our final project assignment in fulfillment of the course Coding 3: Data Analysis & Management with Python, at the MSc in Business Analytics program of the Central European University. 

Our chosen assignment was to analyse baseball matches data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018?select=games.csv&fbclid=IwAR3CxTEd_RQtheRGB_r1ipD03WS0l5pY9M-kLrVKyN_oJRpK3i9FSLCZmLE), & merged with weather data obtained via the [Visual Crossing API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).  

Data is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018?select=games.csv&fbclid=IwAR3CxTEd_RQtheRGB_r1ipD03WS0l5pY9M-kLrVKyN_oJRpK3i9FSLCZmLE), & weather-related data was collected on e.g. precipitation via the [Visual Crossing API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).  

Potential areas to explore: 
 - game length vs weather dependence
 - wind speed effect on game performance


1. Whether game length can be explained better by adding variables describing the weather ?
   Can weather data help us explain the length of a game?
2. Can wind speed effect on game performance - how about all match attributes ?
 Does windspeed have an effect on pitch speed?
